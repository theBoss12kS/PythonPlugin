# PythonPlugin
This is a Java class that can be used to embed and use Python codes within a Java file itself.
Just download the .java file and import it into your programs and you are ready to go. 
NOTE: I have made this file using JDK17, but it does not use any features specifically available in JDK17. So, it should work for all of you, including those of you on JDK1.x.
